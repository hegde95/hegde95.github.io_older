Microalgae are an alternative source for renewable energy to overcome the energy crises caused by exhaustion of fuel reserves. Algal biofuel technology demands a cost effective strategy for net profitable productivity. Inconsistent illumination intensities hinder microalgal growth. The light-utilizing efficiency of the cells is critical. Light scarcity leads to low production and high intensities cause photo-inhibition. We report effective usage of LEDs of different band wavelengths on the growth of microalgae in a closed, controlled environment to generate biomass and lipid yields. Among the different intensity and wavelengths tested. The light intensities of 500 lx of blue-red combination gave maximum biomass in terms of cell density. LED of red light 220 lx wavelength doubled the lipid dry weight from 30% (w/w) in white light to 60% (w/w). Thin layer lipid chromatogram demonstrated a dense and prominent spot of triacylglycerols in the red light, 220 lx grown cultures. The FTIR profile indicates that different wavelength exposure did not alter the functional groups or change the chemical composition of the extracted lipids ensuring the quality of the product. We reiterate the fact that combination of red and blue LEDs is favoured over white light illumination for generation of biomass. In addition, we report an exciting finding of exposure to LEDs of red wavelength post-biomass generation lead to enhanced lipid production. This simple process doubled the lipid content harvested in 20 days culture period.
